## This repository collects code for eclectic technical topics that i always wanted to explore.

Hello and thank you for stopping by!

Its been more more than a decade since i wrote my first piece of code! Oh, what pure joy to see it successfully run for the first time! I believe it was a "calculator" in Visual FoxPro :P. Before you get all impressed, let me explain - it was a simple console program which asked you to provide two integers and then type in the operation of your choice ( +, -, *, /).

I may have come along way since then, but boy do i still crave that "fresh-out-of-compiler" binaries smell.. You know, the joy of being a beginner and learning something new.. that first moment when you "get it"!

I am starting this repository to collect silly little projects which help me learn new things. I mean, why not - its better than saving it a consoleApp123.sln on my D:\ drive!

I call it book of dumbness not in jest! We all start dumb, so lets embrace it!
